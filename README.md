# ZSH config

## To-dos
- [ ] Add some description to this readme file
- [ ] Remember what was the to-do I's gonna add
- [ ] Separate each functions from keybindings into their own `.zsh` files
    - [ ] Insert into some `bin` directory (?)
- [ ] Figure how to not wrap line in `'` when trying to quote something
- [ ] Vim motions? Perhaps on `tmux`
